# ischia_vents_habitats
Scripts and data for functional diversity under ocean acidification across different habitat types

Data architecture> Scripts and data are from the folder named "seb" within the master branch valeriano/nuria_acid. Dowloaded from github on 2021-12-29. 

folder data> data for the analysis, including raw data 
folder FD> functional diversity files
folder plot> plots obtained

Scripts
A dataset for FD: preparing datasets for analysis using raw data
B FD: computing FD with the new package
C mean beta: Correlation of beta-diversity between taxonomic and functional facets as boxplot and scatter plot. Figures for SM 
D trait dominance: category abundance for each trait across habitats and pH conditions. Remove it? 
E mds permdisp: taxonomic and functional MDS based on hill numbers with stats
F functional hull: new figure FD with Ambient and Low pH conditions
G diversity indices: diversity indices across habitats and 2 pH conditions witth stats
H change trait abund: Change in trait abundance with pH across habitats
